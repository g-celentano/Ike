**Ike** is a time-scheduling app the helps you to organize and better use your time, based on the *Eisenhower* matrix, meaning that every task you need to do can get a priority based on the position inside of this Eisenhower matrix.<br>
"**Why Ike?**" you could be asking... simply enough it was an Eisenhower nickname.

## How does the Eisenhower matrix work?
### Eisenhower matrix follows this scheme that helps understand the priority of each task:

|| Urgent | Not Urgent |
|---| --- | ----------- |
|**Important**| Do it | Schedule it |
|**Not Important**| Delegate It | Delete It |

## How does the app use this matrix?
Based on the schematization of the matrix, the application, at this stage, just helps recording all the tasks you need to do, and according to the importance and urgency of it, the app helps you understand what to do first, with the possibility to see the list of tasks ordered by priority or by deadline, and to not get lost with the amount of tasks, there's also a pie chart visualization, to better understand how many tasks of each priority are there.
